    "question" : "What is the history of the FDV?",
    "answer" : "The Flower Corso is the origin of the Harvest Festival. In 1902, it was under the leadership of members of the “Neuchâtel Cycling Club” wishing to mark the end of the harvest with an original parade that the 1st Edition of the Corso Fleuri was born. This parade, part of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity, is the pride and reputation of the city of Neuchâtel, its region and the canton. After more than a century and more than 90 editions, other cultural and festive events have been added. With the GUGGENMUSIK PROCESS ON FRIDAY EVENING AND WEEKEND, the CHILDREN'S PROCESS ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON, the NUMA-DROZ PLACE SCENE, the SHOW PYRO-MELODIC SATURDAY EVENING, The winegrowers' village on rue du Seyon. All these events take place in the middle of a multitude of stands, amid popular jubilation which attracts more than 300,000 people each year to this locality which usually has 35,000 inhabitants. The event takes place every year on the last weekend of September, from Friday evening to Sunday evening. Traditionally, on Sunday afternoon, the Corso Fleuri parades on Avenue du Premier-Mars. It attracts tens of thousands of spectators from all over Switzerland and elsewhere. Thanks to your support, sponsorship, partnership, we can continue our mission, year after year, remaining dynamic, innovative and adapting to our times. We are delighted to count you among our partners and sponsors, in order to benefit from a great collaboration for an event which is part of our canton and culture."

    "question": "What is the atmosphere, the tone of the party?",
    "answer": "t's a party to celebrate the harvest, to have fun and have a good time with friends. It is a tradition for all\nself-respecting Neuchâtel residents to drink wine from the canton of Neuchâtel and to eat winegrower\nsteak (beef and horse meat). This is reflected throughout the festival and particularly highlighted on rue\ndu Seyon with the village of winegrowers who serve Neuchâtel wines and typical cantonal dishes. The party lasts three days with music for all tastes (including live music) which allows you to have fun until\nthe early hours. There is also a stage to promote Neuchâtel culture (place Numa-Droz). With dance\nshows and DJs from the region providing a crazy atmosphere.\nThe election of Miss and Mister FDV also focuses on a more modern experience without physical selection\ncriteria.\nThe festival is planned for all categories of ages, lifestyle, community, sensations and therefore brings\ntogether all layers of the population who come together in a festive manner.\nThere is something for all tastes, with quieter places like the winegrowers' village or the local lounge,\nduring the day with the children's procession or the corso, full of wonder\nor thrill with the fireworks show, the carousels, Miss and Mister FDV or the Guggenmusik. There is\nalso the culinary aspect with dishes and drinks from various horizons. Finally the music, of different style and\nculture. Even politicians participate to share a relaxed moment with the population. n addition, the harvest festival takes a decidedly more environmentally friendly (ecological)\nand digital turn with the arrival of reusable tableware for payment by electronic bracelet. t is the event of the year in the city of Neuchâtel which is superbly located on the edge of the lake and\nwhich awaits you like 300,000 other people for these three days of popular jubilation."
